// Fix: Replaced invalid placeholder content with a valid TypeScript module export.
// This resolves the "Cannot find name" and "is not a module" errors.
// The base64 string is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual
// base64-encoded content of the resume PDF file.
export const RESUME_PDF_BASE64 = '';
